# FSKview
FSKview is a high-resolution spectrogram for viewing narrowband frequency-shift keyed (FSK) signals in real time. FSKview can be used as a [QRSS](#QRSS) viewer, and if [WSTJ-X](https://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjtx.html) is running FSKview can label [WSPR](doc/WSPR.md) spots directly on the spectrogram in real time.
