## Goals
* multi-threaded FFT analysis
* sensitivity adjustment
* easily put scales on spectrograms when saving image
* polyphase
* QRSS really needs a wikipedia page

## Simulating QRSS Data
* Lots of ideas here came from [Simulation of QRSS Signals](https://www.qsl.net/pa2ohh/12qrsssim1.htm) by PA2OHH
